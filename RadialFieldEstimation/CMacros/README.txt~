0. Beam position histograms are under samweb caloBeamPosPlots_EDM 
1. ReadNearlineTrees to produce calo position plots from nearline
2. PlotCaloYvsRun to produce <y> plots 
3. GetRefPos to produce a file for the reference position, and check for bad calos (calos 5 & 9 which are out of line in the mean subtracted plots)
4. CheckCaloAlignment produces uncertainty due to calo misalignment
5. EstimateRadialField to turn those <y> plots into Br plots
	This is where all uncertainties need to be accounted for.  
6. PlotBrVsDS to present results per dataset
